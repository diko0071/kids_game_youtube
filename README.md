# Bilingual Kids Youtube Game


## Getting Started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

**A fun and educational game for kids aged 1-4 years, designed to help them learn colors, numbers, and letters in two languages while watching cartoons on YouTube. After N minutes of cartoon time, the game switches to a puzzle activity.**

## Features

1. **Color Matching**  
   - Match different colors with objects.  
   - Hear the color names pronounced in both languages.

2. **Counting with Numbers**  
   - Learn to count with fun objects like cakes and ice creams.  
   - Numbers are spoken aloud in both languages to reinforce learning.

3. **Alphabet Learning (Russian)**  
   - Recognize letters from the Russian alphabet.  
   - Hear the letter, its associated sound, and example words starting with that letter.

## Vision

1. **Cartoon-Based Learning**  
   - The game uses content from cartoons and adjusts tasks based on the video.

2. **Age-Appropriate Game Levels**  
   - The game adapts to the child's age. Choose the appropriate age group, and the game's difficulty will scale accordingly.

## How It Works

1. **Watch Cartoons**  
   - Kids can watch their favorite cartoons on YouTube.
   - After a set number of minutes (configurable), the game will prompt the child to solve an educational puzzle related to the cartoon content.

2. **Bilingual Learning**  
   - The game is designed for bilingual children, providing exposure to two languages (e.g., English and Russian) throughout the gameplay.

## Supported Platforms

- Web-based game that can be played on any device with a browser.
